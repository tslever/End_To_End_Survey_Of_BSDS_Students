## Slide 1: End-to-End Survey of BSDS Students

Ms. Kester tasked me with presenting how I would create an end-to-end survey of the students in the Bachelor of Science in Data Science program.

To be concrete, I would like to consider a retrospective questionnaire of recent graduates of the BSDS program.

This questionnaire could be broken up across a student’s program.


## Slide 2: End to End Survey

Here I would like to define “end-to-end survey”.

An end-to-end survey is the process of creating and distributing questions; collecting, analyzing, and reporting on answers; and planning the above.

I would also like to define questionnaire. For our purposes, let a questionnaire be a set of questions.


## Slide 3: General Objectives

I would like to present some general objectives.

We might wish to…

1.	gather comprehensive feedback from recent graduates of the BSDS program;

2.	evaluate various aspects of the BSDS program from the perspectives of recent graduates; and

3.	gather insights to improve the BSDS program and better support future students.


## Slide 4: Specific Objectives

I would like to present some specific objectives.

We might wish to...

1.  create a binary classifier, multiclass classifier, or regression model that may predict whether a student found the BSDS program to be satisfying overall and

2.  understand which predictors are most likely to determine whether a student found the BSDS program to be satisfying overall.


## Slide 5: Collaborators

I would like to consider who I would collaborate with to develop the survey.

Collaborators may include…

1.	you all;

2.	every faculty member, staff member, PhD student, MSDS student, and BSDS student who is willing to respond to an email requesting questions for a hypothetical questionnaire that meets objectives; and

3.	stakeholders, administrative support people, and advisors listed in “Table of Collaborators”.


## Slide 6: Proposal

We may wish to create a formal proposal.

A proposal might have an introduction and sections discussing questions of interest, models, and data visualizations.


## Slide 7: Questionnaire to Improve Course

Before creating questions, we may want to consider the questions and feel of existing questionnaire.

Here is an appealing questionnaire that I personally intend to take in August.

The questionnaire is a web app hosted by Qualtrics, which offers online survey software.


## Slide 8: Comparing Existing Questionnaires

We may want to formally compare existing questionnaires using metadata.

On the right here is the beginning of “Table of Quality Metrics”, which right now has 42 metrics.

We might compare surveys by response rate.

We could use the questions and/or format of the survey with the highest response rate.


## Slide 9: Retrospective Survey of BSDS Program

Here is a screenshot of the beginning of “Retrospective Survey of BSDS Program”, which right now has 50 questions.

The first question, and many questions, ask a student to provide scores for the BSDS program and specific criteria.

Scores are numerical, quantitative, ratio data.

Scores may be used to construct point estimates, visualizations, distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, functional models, and machine learning models.

Some questions that ask for text responses might provide context, validation, student information, or ideas for new questions. Some text might be converted into numbers manually or using a machine learning model.

After developing the survey, we could conduct a pilot test by offering the questions to collaborators. 


## Slide 10: Deployment

We could have our questionnaire be a web app hosted by Qualtrics.

We could email an introduction and link to our survey as finals are winding down.

We could offer money, swag, or other incentives.

We could send out reminders.


## Slide 11: Data Collection

Qualtrics might record responses in a secure and organized way.

I might talk to advisors about how metadata might map to our “Table of Quality Metrics”.

I might talk to advisors about how questionnaire data might map to a “Feature Matrix”, or whether the questionnaire needs to look like a feature matrix.

So what feature matrix do I have in mind?


## Slide 12: Feature Matrix

I envision constructing a two-dimensional table of data from all questionnaires.

The table would have a column for every questionnaire that was at least partially completed.

Right now, the matrix has about 527 features.

Metadata could be added before modeling.

Qualtrics might fill missing values with “NULL”.

Qualtrics might prevent entering invalid values.

We might remove irrelevant text.

We might prefer a score or text when one contradicts the other.

We might convert text to numbers representing certain ideas and/or sentiments.


## Slide 13: Analyses of Feature Matrix

Considering analysis of our feature matrix,

we might rely on autogenerated analyses by Qualtrics or guide analyses using Qualtrics.

Let's take a look at my workbook "Analyses of Feature Matrix".


## Slide 14: Report

After analyzing our feature matrix, we might write a report that could be distributed to stakeholders.

A report might have an introduction, a discussion of data, a discussion of methods, analysis, conclusions, and appendices.

Conclusions may address our general and specific objectives and provide recommendations for further research and action.


## Slide 15: Presentation to Stakeholders

Along with our report, we might give a presentation to stakeholders.

I imagine such a presentation to be like this one, with focus on conclusions.

Some conclusions may address our objectives and provide recommendations.


## Slide 16: Updating Metadata

We may wish to record our questionnaire as complete and add quality metrics to a table for comparing questionnaires.


## Slide 17: Feedback

We may wish to gather feedback on our survey.

Here's the beginning of a questionnaire for the leaders of our survey of students of the BSDS program.

The questionnaire also serves as a good summary of this presentation.

We might add some more questions at the end about meeting to consider changes and final communication, which are my last two slides.

Gathering feedback almost seems like a survey within a survey.

I guess we would use the data of the inner survey as feedback in this survey, and not have feedback for the inner survey.


## Slide 18: Meet to Consider Changes

Based on our questionnaire to students and our questionnaire to leaders, we may wish to consider changes.

We might change the BSDS program or our questionnaire to students.


## Slide 19: Communicate

Finally, we make wish to thank students and leaders who responded.

We might inform students of any changes to the BSDS program.

This is the end of my presentation on how I would create an end-to-end survey of the students in the Bachelor of Science in Data Science program.

Thank you.
